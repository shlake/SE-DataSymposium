<b>OpenRefine
<br>OpenRefine (previously Google Refine) is a tool for data cleaning
that runs through a web browser, and any browser -
Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Explorer - should work fine.
You will need to download Google Refine and install it,
and when you open it, it will run through the browser, but you don't need
an internet connection, and the data will all be stored on your computer.
<ul>
<li>Go to the OpenRefine <a href="http://openrefine.org/download.html">download
page</a>
<li>Click on <i>Mac kit</i> to download the install file
<li>Open the downloaded .dmg file
<li>Drag the icon in to the Applications folder
<li>Double click on the icon and Google Refine will then open in your web browser.
<li>If it doesn't open automatically, open a web broswer after you've started the program and go to the URL <code>http://localhost:3333</code> and you should see OpenRefine.
